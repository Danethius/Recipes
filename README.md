# Recipes
A recipe site I am making to practice HTML

I am making a website with a main index page and links to a few recipes.
I will have to demonstrate my knowldege of basic elements and tags.

I'll demonstrate my ability to produce the basic HTML boilerplate.
I can create the HTML boilerplate from memory or with ! in VScode

Once I have the boilerplate I will have to add content.
To add content I will use head, body, text, list, and anchor/link elements.
I may also add some photos using the img tag to jazz it up.

Lastly, I am going to try to create good atomic commit habits while working on this project. 

Wish me luck!
