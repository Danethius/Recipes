<h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This savory and slightly sweet version of the pork tenderloin is delightful. As with the other recipes we will marinade it for at least 30 minutes, up to 24 hours. To make the marinade you simply stir together the marinade ingredients then pour the marinade over the pork tenderloin in a bowl or large ziplock bag.</p>
